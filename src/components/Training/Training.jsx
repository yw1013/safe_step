        	</div>
        	<p>It is estimated that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men will suffer some type of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse by an intimate partner during their lifetime. As a first responder, you will encounter these individuals often, and in many cases, you may be the first with an opportunity to address the problem. Therefore, it is important that you know how to identify victims and respond accordingly.</p>
        	<p>SafeSteps is a training tool designed specifically for service providers in lines of work that interact with victims of domestic violence frequently. The program is broken down into five major components based in the following acronym:</p>
        	<div className={s.indent}>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>L</span> - Look for warning signs</p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>E</span> - Empathize</p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>A</span> - Ask</p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>S</span> - Share resources</p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>T</span> - Thorough documentation</p>
        	</div>
        	<p>As you move through this training, learn to ask yourself, “What is the L.E.A.S.T. I can do?”. With in-depth explanations for each step and an opportunity to practice responding  in a variety of scenarios, SafeSteps will help you become efficient and effective in your interactions with victims of domestic violence.</p>

        	<h2><span className={s.purple}>L</span>ook for warning signs</h2>
        	<p>Knowing how to recognize a victim of intimate partner violence is the first step in addressing the situation effectively. The signs can come in a number of forms, including obvious physical injury due to trauma, emotional or behavioral patterns, or chronic physical symptoms. You may notice a certain distribution of injuries, or unusual behavior by someone’s partner. No two cases of domestic violence are the same, but you will notice many of  the same warning signs in each instance. It is important to know what those signs are, and to make sure you are observing individuals carefully so that you do not miss any red flags.</p>

        	<p>Once you have determined that someone is a  victim of domestic violence, your next step is to provide them with the support and information they need to move forward.</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Have basic familiarity with your state’s domestic violence shelters and support centers</li>
        		<li>Memorize the national and/or local hotline numbers</li>
        		<li>Keep in mind that in many cases you may not be able to send home paper copies with resources listed, since an abusive partner may monitor the victim’s activities closely. Instead be prepared to use alternative methods such as a disguised email, or share only the most necessary resources like the hotline number and the name of the local shelter or website that can be easily remembered</li>
        		<li>If you do not know the resources very well, it is important that you know of someone who does. Be able to refer the victim to someone who can help them (if it is not you) before you are out of contact with him or her</li>
        		<li>Do not pressure or force a victim to follow any particular course of action-- in other words, do not tell them what to do. Recommend, gently encourage, and provide all of the options but remember that these individuals are in situations where they feel powerless. Show support for their decisions and reinforce that they are in control of the situation</li>
        		<li>Talk through and create a safety plan with the victim.</li>

        	<h2><span className={s.purple}>T</span>horough documentation</h2>
        	<p>Documenting each encounter with a potential victim of domestic violence can prove essential, both as a record of incidents to spot an ongoing problem or as evidence in cases that go to court. For this reason, it is important that you give careful attention to detail in your reports. In order for your documentation to be counted as objective, third-party evidence in legal proceedings, there are a few guidelines that you must follow:</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Be as accurate and comprehensive as possible when documenting any injuries or information</li>
        		<li><b>Write legibly</b> so that reports are easy to read</li>
        		<li>When possible, take photographs to include in your documentation as proof of injuries that may fade or disappear by the time a case goes to court</li>
        		<li>Include specific statements from the victim about the abuse and be sure to identify the victim as the speaker using quotes-- this type of commentary is given a lot of credibility in the legal system because it occurs so close in time to the actual instance of domestic violence</li>
        		<li>Describe the victim’s demeanor, even if it does not seem consistent with the rest of the evidence </li>
        		<li>Record as many details as you can about the <b>who, what, where, when, and how</b> of both the incident and your encounter with the individual</li>
        		<li>Use clear, concise, objective language</li>
        		<li>Avoid documenting your own conclusions (domestic violence, rape, assault and battery) as those judgments are made by the court. Simply state what you see and hear</li>
        	</ul>
        	<p>Even if your documentation is not used in court, it is important that you are thorough in your record keeping. The information that you take down may be the only proof that an incident occurred, and you never know when that evidence may be needed. Thorough documentation also ensures that you are paying attention to the victim and being diligent in your response to the situation.</p>

        	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
        	<p>In this line of work where time is a limited resource, thinking and acting quickly under pressure are essential skills. As much as you want to take ample time to assist a victim in crisis, that is not always feasible. Familiarity with these steps can ease the burden of a ticking clock, since a more comprehensive knowledge accelerates your ability to recognize and respond. With increased knowledge comes increased efficiency, allowing you to invest more in each individual.</p>
			<p>The easiest way to commit the response steps to memory is with the acronym, and remembering to ask “What is the <b>L.E.A.S.T.</b> I can do?”</p>
        	<div className={s.indent}>
        		<p><b>To recap:</b></p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>L</span> - Look for warning signs</p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>E</span> - Empathize</p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>A</span> - Ask</p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>S</span> - Share resources</p>
        		<p><span className={s.purple}>T</span> - Thorough documentation</p>
        	</div>
        	<p>Above all else, be intentional about responding with compassion, patience, and care. These victims come from settings where they are made to feel helpless-- an empowering exchange could be the catalyst that helps them out of an abusive situation.</p>
